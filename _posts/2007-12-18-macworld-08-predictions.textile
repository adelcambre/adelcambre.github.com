title: Macworld '08 Predictions
---

I was chatting with some friends today about Macworld 2008, and we discussed what we were expecting to see.  I thought I would put my predictions here for posterity's sake.  

So here we go, in no particular order:

* iPhone SDK
<b>Mentioned, but not released</b>
* No new iPhone hardware mentioned (new hardware with 3g and gps announced at wwdc, released in October)
<b>Correct (no new hardware, software update though)</b>
* No new ipods
<b>Correct</b>
* Refresh to the whole portable line, speed bumps, led backlit displays
<b>Wrong (not yet anyway)</b>
* Ultra portable macbook, 13" screen, 3 lbs, SSD (flash disk drive), led backlit display, no optical drive, base $1600, top of the line $2000
<b>Pretty damn accurate, although way off on the top end price. </b>
* Mac Pro refesh, maybe all new look
<b>Refresh a week before, same look</b>
* Appletv refresh
<b>Correct</b>

What do you think? I am drooling over the ultra portable, really hoping to see that one.  Also very curious what the iPhone sdk will be like.  

<b>Updated with results, these predictions were made on December 18th</b>

What did I miss?

* iTunes movie rentals
* Time Capsule
